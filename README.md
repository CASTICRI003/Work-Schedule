# Work-Schedule

## Description
Plan out everything you're doing for the day! And then possibly do none of those things because you needed a little 'me time'. Your 9-5 will never know what hit it!

It's easy! just type in the boxes what you will be doing those hours and click that save button to save what you just typed. Items that show red will be things you totally (didn't) do earlier in the day. Gray will be what's happening in the present. Green is your upcoming items.
